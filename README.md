# Math Web Application with AWS

This project demonstrates how to design and build a simple web application using five different AWS services: Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The documentation covers the roles and integration of each service, resulting in a fully functional math web application.

## Prerequisites

- A text editor (such as Notepad or Notepad++)
- An AWS account and access to the Console. NOTE: Administrator permissions are required.

## Project Overview

Hereâ€™s all the code needed to build the application:

- index-ORIGINAL.html
- PowerOfMathFunction - Lambda-ORIGINAL.txt
- Execution Role Policy JSON.txt
- PowerOfMathFunction - Lambda-FINAL.txt
- index.html

## Project Steps

### 1. Overview of the Services and Application
Discuss the services used and the application being built.

### 2. Architecting the Web Application
Design the architecture of the web application, explaining the roles of Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

### 3. Setting Up the Environment
Ensure you have the necessary tools and access to follow along.

### 4. Creating and Hosting the Web Page
Create an `index.html` page from scratch using a text editor and deploy it using AWS Amplify.

### 5. Implementing Math Functionality with Lambda
Create a Python Lambda function to perform math calculations, test it, and set up an API Gateway to invoke the function.

### 6. Persisting Data with DynamoDB
Create a DynamoDB table to store math results and configure the necessary permissions for Lambda to write to the table.

### 7. Integrating the Frontend with the Backend
Update the `index.html` page to call the API Gateway endpoint and display the results.

### 8. Deploying the Application
Redeploy the updated `index.html` page using AWS Amplify and verify the functionality of the complete application.

### 9. Cleanup
Delete resources after completing the project to avoid unnecessary charges.
